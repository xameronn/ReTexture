## About
**ReTexture** is a [KSL](https://github.com/trbflxr/ksl) mod for changing textures in CarX Drift Racing Online.
* **Resource pack:** A file bundle for texture replacement.
* **Resource pack manager:** Allows you to quickly load/unload any resouce packs that you need.
* **UI builder:** The mod features a built-in editor for creation or editing of existing resource pack without leaving the game.
* **Prioritization:** To avoid conflicts between resource packs the plugin loads resource packs per set priority.
* **Hot-Reload:** The mod supports adding new or editing existing resource packs and automatically reloads the textures.
* **Format support:** Resource packs use the textures in PNG/JPG/PSD formats.
* **Texture dump:** Allows to dump all the available textures from the map/cars.
